# Open Data Practical
Visualization of COVID-19 tests (positive and negative, grouped by countries) inspired by https://koroonakaart.ee/en (https://github.com/okestonia/koroonakaart) for IFI7402.DT (Tallinn University)

Data on COVID-19 tests performed in Estonia is provided by Terviseamet (https://www.terviseamet.ee/et/koroonaviirus/avaandmed)
https://opendata.digilugu.ee/opendata_covid19_test_results.csv

Population (by counties) data taken from: https://github.com/okestonia/koroonakaart/blob/master/TEHIK_Open_Data_Loading_Scripts/constants.py

## Pre-processing
Latest available (26/04/20) test results dataset (csv) was aggregated in Python (count of tests per county) and blended with population dataset. Python code (markdown) available at: https://github.com/olexandr7/BOLD.19-20/blob/master/lecture%202%20-%20open_data_practical/OpenDataPractical.md   

## Visualization
Resulting chart was made in Tableau Desktop (student license) and could be viewed at https://public.tableau.com/shared/JH7CSZTMK?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
